# Algorithm-P3

Write a program implementing some operations on binary search trees. Requirements to your program:
•	The program should be menu-driven. The user will enter the code of operation. In the output, show that all functions work properly.
•	You can use the code of all tree functions from your textbook. In the beginning of the program, create an array of integers from the following list:	
30, 10, 45, 38, 20, 50, 25, 33, 8, 12 (in this particular order). 
Create a binary search tree with nodes containing these numbers as key values
(here the function  TREE-INSERT must be used).
•	Display the results of inorder, postorder and preorder  traversals of your binary tree.
•	Show the result of TREE-SEARCH function for the keys 38 and 9. Show also the sequence of nodes examined in each case.
•	Delete the node with the key 10 (use the function TREE-DELETE).
•	Display the results of inorder, postorder and preorder  traversals of your new  binary tree.

Submit your code and output results in a single file.
